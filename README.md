Overview
This project involves designing a set of responsive travel destination cards using HTML and CSS. Each card highlights a popular travel destination with a compelling image, key attributes (such as nature, culture, fashion), a brief description, and a call-to-action button that links to more detailed information about the destination.

Key Features
Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal display on various devices and screen sizes.
Clean and Modern Aesthetics: The cards use a modern font, clean lines, and ample white space to create a visually appealing design.
Interactive Elements: Each card features a clickable button that guides users to a more comprehensive resource for each destination.
Detailed Components
HTML Structure:
Header: Includes meta tags for character set and viewport settings to ensure proper rendering on all devices.
Body: Contains a set of cards, each representing a different travel destination (e.g., Bali, Paris, Singapore, Chicago, Dubai).
CSS Styling:
Font Import: Uses Google Fonts to import the 'Poppins' font, which enhances the overall look and feel of the text.
Global Styles: Resets margin and padding to zero for all elements to maintain consistency.
Body Styling: Sets a background color and padding for the body, and uses Flexbox for aligning the cards.
Card Styling: Defines the dimensions, background color, and margin for each card to ensure a uniform appearance.
Image Styling: Adds padding and border-radius to images for a polished look.
Content Styling: Applies padding and font styles to the content section, including heading and paragraph elements.
Capsule Styling: Styles the attribute capsules with borders, padding, and rounded corners.
Button Styling: Centers the button, applies padding, background color, text color, and other styles to make it visually distinct and clickable.
